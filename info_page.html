<h2>What is the beer game?</h2>
<div class="text-container">
  <p>The Beer Game is a supply chain simulation game that demonstrates the challenges of managing a supply chain with multiple players. The goal is to minimize costs associated with holding and ordering stock while meeting customer demand. Players assume the roles of different stages in the supply chain, such as retailer, wholesaler, distributor, and manufacturer, and work to manage inventory and avoid backlogs while responding to orders and supply chain delays.</p>
